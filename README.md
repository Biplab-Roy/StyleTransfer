Development of an Adaptable Deep Learning Model for Artistic Style Transfer
===================

- - - - 

I'm excited to discuss the Neural Style Transfer system that I've developed. This project involves using deep learning techniques to merge the content of one image with the artistic style of another, producing visually appealing stylized images.

## Dependecies
---
```
torch=2.1.1
torchvision=0.16.1
numpy=0.16.1
pillow>=5.3.0
tqdm=4.65.0
```

## Run The Notebook
---
The content.jpg and style.jpg can be replaced with own files. Jupyter notebook can run in a environment satifying the dependencies with `python >= 3.10`.

More about the project has been discussed in the notebook.
